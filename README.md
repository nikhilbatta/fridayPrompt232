# _What Language Is Best For You?_

#### _This is a program to see what language is best for you, August 16, 2019_

#### By _**Nikhil Batta**_

## Description

_This webpage is a form that I created in html and made user interaction with jQuery, this program that I created goes into the form and grabs the users selected value that they chose, then when they click submit stores them in a variable and grabs each of the nested forms values and adds them together to make a "totalscore". The total score will determine what div class in the html will show up because of the if else branching statement. The try again button will clear the values so the user can go and take the quiz again without refreshing the page._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _git clone_
* _atom ._


_JQUERY JAVASCRIPT BOOTSTRAP_

## Known Bugs

_The user only has to select the values that equal 4, not the whole form._

## Support and contact details

_If you guys have any questions feel free to contact me at nbatta08@gmail.com_

## Technologies Used

_I used html, css, javascript , and jQuery. I put in a cool css slide in animation formy h1 tags._
